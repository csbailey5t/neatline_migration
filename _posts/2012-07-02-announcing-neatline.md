***What do you get when you cross archives and artifacts with timelines, modern and historical maps, and an appreciation for the interpretive aims of humanities scholarship?***

Today, the [Scholars&#8217; Lab][1] is proud to announce the launch of [Neatline][2], our set of [Omeka][3] plugins for hand-crafted geo-temporal visualization and interpretation. Here, you can download the [1.0 software][4], see [sample exhibits][5] or play in the [sandbox][6], and read more [about the project][7], including [news][8] and [history][9].

[Neatline][2] is a geotemporal exhibit-builder that allows you to create beautiful, complex maps and narrative sequences from collections of archives and artifacts, and to connect your maps and narratives with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. In other words, Neatline lets you make hand-crafted, interactive stories as interpretive expressions of an archival or cultural heritage collection.

Every Neatline exhibit can be your own close reading of a humanities collection &#8212; expressed in the visual vernacular. Ours is a small-data approach in a &#8220;big data&#8221; world.

Stay tuned to the [Scholars&#8217; Lab blog][10] and to this site for a series of posts and screencasts to be shared over the course of the next two weeks. We&#8217;ll be providing support for this [open-source software][11] on the [Omeka forums][12] and [dev list][13].
