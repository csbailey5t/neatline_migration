I&#8217;ve called [Neatline][1], the [Digital Humanities Start-Up][2] project Adam Soroka and I began developing in September, a &#8220;contribution to interpretive humanities scholarship in the visual vernacular.&#8221;

Huh?

This project will allow scholars (and other stewards of cultural heritage) to create Web-based geospatial and temporal visualizations that build on the rich [EAD metadata][3] libraries produce in describing their archival collections and making them more discoverable &#8212; but the crucial twist is that we didn&#8217;t want to think of our Neatline visualizations as *products* of the metadata. They&#8217;re not brain-dead algorithmic output or some kind of thoughtless expression of the archivist&#8217;s (nuanced, but necessarily broad) stance toward historical or literary documents of interest. (Yes, I&#8217;m asking for it; bring it on!) In other words, Neatline isn&#8217;t about the parsing of placenames and automated population of timelines with data. Rather, we&#8217;ve conceived this tool (really, as development proceeds, this *approach*, because Neatline is emerging as an arrangement of instruments and an attitude toward their use) as a kind of *playspace for the scholarly interpretative act*. In future posts, we&#8217;ll describe our development effort and I&#8217;ll delve a little into the conceptual background for Neatline in the [Temporal Modelling][4] project I undertook several years ago with [Johanna Drucker][5]. 

In the meantime, you can read about how we&#8217;re employing the [Omeka][6] plugin framework as a way to handle GIS services for scanned historical maps on the ScholarsLab.org project pages for Neatline-in-progress and our larger [Omeka plugin work][7], or you can check out our dedicated [project blog][8]. &#8212; Bethany
