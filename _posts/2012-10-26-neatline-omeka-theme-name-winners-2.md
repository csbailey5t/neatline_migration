After extensive deliberations at the Scholars&#8217; Lab, we&#8217;re pleased to announce that we have two winners of the Neatline Omeka Theme Name Contest:Amanda Visconti and the theme name &#8220;Astrolabe,&#8221; and Franky Abbott with the theme name &#8220;Neatscape.&#8221; We&#8217;ll be getting in touch with Amanda and Franky separately, to get those beautiful Neatline tshirts their way. This means we&#8217;ll develop and release **two** Omeka themes. (I&#8217;ll have my work cut out for me, but it&#8217;s wonderful work.) We&#8217;ll make those themes compatible with the upcoming 2.0 version of Omeka, so look for those themes shortly after Omeka 2.0 is released!
