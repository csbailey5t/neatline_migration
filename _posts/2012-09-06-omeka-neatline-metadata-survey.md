As part of our collaboration on [Omeka][2] + [Neatline][3], the Scholars&#8217; Lab and Omeka development teams are seeking your assistance to help make our projects more useful across many scholarly disciplines&#8211;including beyond the humanities and cultural heritage fields in which they originated. We&#8217;ve developed a short survey asking questions about new data types that Omeka+Neatline could display and metadata formats that it might import and describe.

While Omeka + Neatline can handle many metadata standards and formats familiar to humanities scholars, archivists, and museum professionals&#8211;such as Encoded Archival Description schema (EAD), Text Encoding Initiative schema (TEI), Dublin Core (DC) and Visual Resources Association Core (VRA Core)&#8211;it is also possible to import simple CSV files or any flat XML format, with potential to handle other formats more applicable to your field&#8217;s standards.

We&#8217;d like to hear about other specific standards and formats that could make Omeka + Neatline more helpful to your research and scholarship.

Thank you for taking a few minutes to answer our survey!
