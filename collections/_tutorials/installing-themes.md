1. Download and unzip one of our [custom Neatline Themes](/themes/) (follow the *Download* links to the associated Github repository). Download the .zip file to your desktop for easy retrieval. 

2. Locate your Omeka installation and login to access your site.

3. Navigate to your Omeka folder (this should have the same name as your Omeka install)

4. Open your Omeka folder and locate the '/themes' folder within.

5. Copy or move the unzipped theme folder from your desktop (or from where you saved this folder) and place it withing the 'omeka/themes' folder located in step #4.

6. Log in to your Omeka admin panel (found at the url: 'your-site-url/admin'), and click on the 'Appearance' option in the top navigation bar. You should immediately be in the Themes section:

    - If its not there, double-check that the folder is in the right location ('/themes') and that the folder name for the theme does not start with 'theme-'. 

8. The custom theme should now be installed and visible.
    

9. Click “Configure Theme” if desired.
