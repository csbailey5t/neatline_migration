Yesterday I [tweeted][1] asking for name suggestions for an [Omeka][2] theme based on the design of [Neatline.org][3]. We&#8217;ve already gotten a few great responses, but we&#8217;ve decided to kick it up a notch. We&#8217;ve got a few Neatline t-shirts. They&#8217;re nice t-shirts, as demonstrated by our friendly Scholars&#8217; Lab Waynebot:

Between now and next Thursday morning, say 9AM Charlottesville time (east coast US), leave us a name suggestion through Twitter (using the #neatlinetheme hash tag) or in the comments on this post. The Neatline team will look them over, pick one, and the winner will get a lovely Neatline t-shirt, some Scholars&#8217; Lab stickers, and a credit line in the theme&#8217;s code. The person who mentions a name first will get credit for it. No multiple winners, we don&#8217;t have that many tshirts! The name could be a play on &#8220;Neatline&#8221; or something having to do with functionality of our lovely suite of Neatline plugins. Or it could be something totally random. Common decency, of course, is most appreciated.

We&#8217;ll announce a winner next Friday morning. So send us a theme name!
