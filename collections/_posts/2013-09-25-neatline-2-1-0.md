We&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of [Neatline 2.1.0][1]! This is a fairly large maintenance release that adds new features, patches up some minor bugs, and ships some improvements to the UI in the editing environment. Some of the highlights:

*   **A &#8220;fullscreen&#8221; mode** (re-added from the 1.x releases), which makes it possible to link to a page that *just* displays a Neatline exhibit in isolation, scaled to the size of the screen, without any of the regular Omeka site navigation. Among other things, this makes it much easier to embed a Neatline exhibit as an `iframe` on other websites (eg, a WordPress blog) &#8211; just set the `src` attribute on the `iframe` equal to the URL for the fullscreen exhibit view. Eg: 
    
    
    Thanks [coryduclos][2], [colonusgroup][3], and [martiniusDE][4] for letting us know that this was a pain point.</li> 
    *   **A series of UI improvements to the editing environment** that should make the exhibit-creation workflow a bit smoother. We bumped up the size of the &#8220;New Record&#8221; button, padded out the list of records, and made the &#8220;X&#8221; buttons used to close record forms a bit larger and easier-to-click. Also, in the record edit form, the &#8220;Save&#8221; and &#8220;Delete&#8221; buttons are now stuck into place at the bottom of the panel, meaning that you don&#8217;t have to scroll down to the bottom of the form every time you save. Much easier!

    *   **Fixes for a handful of small bugs**, mostly cosmetic or involving uncommon edge cases. Notably, 2.1.0 fixes a problem that was causing item imports to fail when the Omeka installation was using the Amazon S3 storage adapter, as we do for our faculty-project installations here at UVa.</ul> 
    Check out the [release notes][6] on GitHub for the full list of changes, and grab the new code from the [Omeka add-ons repository][1]. And, as always, be sure to send comments, concerns, bug reports, and feature requests in our direction.
    
    In other Neatline-related news, be sure to check out Katherine Jentleson&#8217;s Neatline-enhanced essay &#8220;[&#8216;Not as rewarding as the North&#8217;: Holger Cahill&#8217;s Southern Folk Art Expedition][7],&#8221; which just won the Smithsonian&#8217;s Archives of American Art Graduate Research Essay Prize. I met Katherine at a workshop at Duke back in the spring, and it&#8217;s been a real pleasure to learn about how she&#8217;s using Neatline in her work!
