Today we&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of [**Neatline 2.0.2**][1]! This is a maintenance release that adds a couple of minor features and fixes some bugs we&#8217;ve rooted up in the last few weeks:

*   Fixes a bug that was causing item-import queries to fail when certain combinations of other plugins were installed alongside Neatline (thanks Jenifer Bartle and Trip Kirkpatrick for bringing this to our attention).

*   Makes it possible to toggle the real-time spatial querying on and off for each individual exhibit. This can be useful if you have a small exhibit (eg, 10-20 records) that can be loaded into the browser all at once without causing performance problems, and you want to avoid the added load on the server incurred by the dynamic querying.

*   Fixes some performance issues with the OpenStreetMap layer in Chrome.

And more! Check out the [release notes][2] for the full list of changes, and grab the new code from the [Omeka add-ons repository][1]. Also, watch this space for a couple of other Neatline-related releases in the coming weeks. Jeremy and I are working on a series of themes for Omeka specifically designed to display Neatline projects, including the NeatLight theme, which is currently used on the [Neatline Labs][3] site I&#8217;ve started playing around with (still a work in progress). We&#8217;re also just about ready to cut off a public release of the NeatlineText plugin, which makes it possible to connect records in Neatline exhibits to individual sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words in text documents (check out [this][4] example).

Until then, give the new code a spin, and let us know what you think!
