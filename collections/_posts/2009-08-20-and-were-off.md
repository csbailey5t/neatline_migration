The public [announcement has been made][1], so Adam Soroka and I can now share the news that we&#8217;ve been funded by the NEH&#8217;s [Office of Digital Humanities][2] and the [IMLS][3] to pursue our &#8220;Neatline&#8221; project.  We&#8217;ll begin working again in September in earnest, on a tool that Adam prototyped in support of a code4lib [pre-conference workshop][4] he gave earlier this year.  Look to this site for updates along the way, and for a full description of the project (including notes on our test cases &#8212; horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and Civil War mapmaker Jedediah Hotchkiss &#8212; and our advisory board and collaborators) to be posted soon.
