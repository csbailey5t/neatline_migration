A lot of extra (detachable-from-Neatline) goodness is resulting from our decision to reconceive this project as **an approach** rather than a stand-alone tool &#8212; and therefore as a collection of [Omeka][1] plugins. One example of this is the recent release for testing, by [Scholars&#8217; Lab][2] R&D, of a SIMILE Timeline plugin for Omeka. [Wayne Graham][3], who heads our R&D unit, takes the opportunity to describe the creation process on the Scholars&#8217; Lab [blog][4], in a very useful post (very creatively) titled, &#8220;[Omeka Timeline Plugin][5].&#8221;
