# Neatline Exhibits: An Overview

## At a glance

  - An exhibit is the "canvas" for a Neatline project, the environment in which the content is displayed. 
  - [Exhibit-level settings](/docs/creating-exhibits#exhibit-settings) define basic, high-level defaults for the project (title, base layers, prose narrative, etc).
  - Each exhibit has its own [editing environment](/docs/editor-overview), where you can create a collection of records (the contents of the exhibit).
  - Likewise, each exhibit has a separate page on the [public-facing](/docs/publishing-exhibits) version of the website.
  - Each installation of Neatline can contain an indefinite number of exhibits.

## Exhibits Overview

Each Neatline project has its own exhibit, which can be thought of as the "canvas" or "environment" for the project - the set of base [maps](/docs/map-based-exhibits) or [images](/docs/image-based-exhibits) on top of which the content is displayed, the text narrative that introduces or describes the project, and the combination of user-interface widgets and components that are enabled for the project (timelines, lists of waypoints, etc).

These high-level configuration options are defined using the [**Exhibit Settings** form](/docs/creating-exhibits#exhibit-settings), which is used to both create new exhibits and edit existing exhibits. Once an exhibit has been created and configured, you can add content to the exhibit by opening the [editing environment](/docs/editor-overview) for the exhibit (generally called "the editor"), a specialized, interactive map-making application that makes it possible to create and manipulate a collection of records, which make up the actual content of the exhibit.

Most of the work happens in the editor. You might spend just a couple minutes in the **Exhibit Settings** form, and a couple months building out the content in the editing environment.
