# Editing Record Opacities

## At a glance

  - Opacities are stored as 3-digit decimal values between 0.00 (completely translucent) and 1.00 (completely opaque).
  - To change an opacity value, you can type directly into the field.
  - Or you can click on the field and drag up or down on the page, causing the value to change smoothly.
  - As an opacity is changed, the new value will be automatically previewed on the map.

### Examples:

  - `0.00`
  - `1.00`
  - `0.56`

## Fill Opacity

The opacity of the "body" or "area" of points and polygons on the map (the area inside the lines, not including the lines themselves).

## Fill Opacity (Selected)

The opacity of the "body" or "area" of points and polygons on the map _when the record is highlighted or selected_ (eg, when the cursor hovers or clicks on the shape).
